          <h2>Slay that look! But make it Sustainable</h2>
          <p>
            In modern marketing, the word “green” has become synonymous with
            “organic” or “healthy.” When a consumer sees the phrase “green
            cosmetics,” they will automatically make eco-friendly assumptions
            about the product or company. But the field of green cosmetics still
            needs clarification. Typically, the term is used to describe
            products using environmentally-friendly formulations, production
            practices or packaging methods. In the United States, the Federal
            Trade Commission (FTC) has published guidelines to clarify what
            green or natural means in marketing terms, though these guidelines
            are still loosely defined. With respect to the cosmetics industry,
            “green” and “sustainable” cosmetics are defined as cosmetic products
            using natural ingredients produced from renewable raw materials.
            Many companies use petrochemical ingredients derived from petrol, a
            non-renewable and economically volatile resource. Bio-based
            oleochemicals, on the other hand, derive from renewable plant and
            bacteria sources and are the crux of the green cosmetics movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cosmetics developers worldwide are doggedly pursuing these
            oleochemicals, along with any potential sources for them. Some
            examples of common sources include: Natural Oils: Palm and coconut
            oils are often used to derive fatty alcohols, which are used as
            chemical surfactants. Other oils include argan oil and avocado oil.
            Glycerine, a derivative of palm oil, is a common byproduct.
            Agricultural Plants: Soybeans, corn and other agricultural plants
            are used throughout the cosmetic industry to produce oils and
            alcohols. Green cosmetic emulsifiers, surfactants and biocatalysts
            are derived using these plants, which can be cheaply and sustainably
            sourced. Bacteria: One example of a renewable resource currently
            under development is the Deinococcus bacteria, a bacterium studied
            by Deinove in France for its chemical production properties. Deinove
            has used the bacterium to create aromatic ingredients and pigments
            for the cosmetic industry, representing a potential market value in
            the hundreds of millions of dollars. Manufacturers split these raw
            materials into oleochemicals at a processing plant. The fats or oils
            are divided by hydrolysis, which uses water, or alcoholysis, which
            uses alcohol.
          </p>

            By using natural, oleochemical sources, sustainable cosmetics avoid
            many of the toxic elements found in popular brands. These chemicals
            damage environmental and human health, and consumers should never
            read them on a “green” label. BHA and BHT: BHA and BHT are synthetic
            antioxidants used as preservatives, and they are most common in
            lipsticks and moisturizing creams. The European Commission has
            released evidence that BHA and BHT disrupt the endocrine system.
            Coal tar dyes: On labels, coal tar dyes are listed as
            p-phenylenediamine or colors titled “CI” and followed by a
            five-digit number. These dyes are mixtures of petrochemicals, and
            they have been linked to cancer in humans. Formaldehyde-releasing
            preservatives: These preservatives are present in a wide range of
            cosmetics, as well as in cleaning products such as toilet bowl
            cleaners. As their name suggests, formaldehyde-releasing
            preservatives continuously release small amounts of formaldehyde, a
            known human carcinogen. Aluminum: Commonly used in antiperspirants,
            aluminum enters the body through the underarm tissue and blocks
            sweat ducts. However, it has also been linked to breast cancer,
            Alzheimer’s disease and osteoporosis. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP): Often
            found in nail products, DBP is a solvent for dyes. Considered toxic
            to human reproduction, it enhances the ability of other chemicals to
            cause genetic mutations. While Canada has banned DBP from all
            children’s toys, no action has yet been taken against its presence
            in cosmetics.
