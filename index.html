          <p>Why you should uses sustainable Makeup only:
            By using natural, oleochemical sources, sustainable cosmetics avoid
            many of the toxic elements found in popular brands. These chemicals
            damage environmental and human health, and consumers should never
            read them on a “green” label. BHA and BHT: BHA and BHT are synthetic
            antioxidants used as preservatives, and they are most common in
            lipsticks and moisturizing creams. The European Commission has
            released evidence that BHA and BHT disrupt the endocrine system.
            Coal tar dyes: On labels, coal tar dyes are listed as
            p-phenylenediamine or colors titled “CI” and followed by a
            five-digit number. These dyes are mixtures of petrochemicals, and
            they have been linked to cancer in humans. Formaldehyde-releasing
            preservatives: These preservatives are present in a wide range of
            cosmetics, as well as in cleaning products such as toilet bowl
            cleaners. As their name suggests, formaldehyde-releasing
            preservatives continuously release small amounts of formaldehyde, a
            known human carcinogen. Aluminum: Commonly used in antiperspirants,
            aluminum enters the body through the underarm tissue and blocks
            sweat ducts. However, it has also been linked to breast cancer,
            Alzheimer’s disease and osteoporosis. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP): Often
            found in nail products, DBP is a solvent for dyes. Considered toxic
            to human reproduction, it enhances the ability of other chemicals to
            cause genetic mutations. While Canada has banned DBP from all
            children’s toys, no action has yet been taken against its presence
            in cosmetics.
